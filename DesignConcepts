CAP Theorom for distributed system

Consistency : Same data at every node

Availability : Response to every request

Partition Tolerence : Tolerant for network failures. Ability to operate even in case of network failures. Paxos/Raft.

Cost

Trade-off

Consistency over Availability  : Relation databases(ACID). Cannot provide availability. But is consistent.
Availability vs Partitional Tolerance : Cassandra ( Eventual Consistency)
Consistency vs Partitiona Tolerence : Consensus Algorithm and Paxos Algorithm

Here is an outline of the preparation strategies and practical tips for acing a system design interview:

## 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻

## Scalability (https://www.designgurus.io/blog/grokking-system-design-scalability)
              Ability of a system to handle an increasing workload, both in terms of data volume and user requests, without compromising its performance. 
Vertical Scaling : Adding more capacity of one machine(increase CPU , memory or storage) 
Horizontal Scaling: Add more servers. Can add or remove based on need(More flexible). Upgrades will not cause down time. Need a Load balancer to distribute the requests. Distributed caching and distributed databases.
Load Balancing: 
Asynchronous Processing (Decoupled services)
Distributed databases ( with sharding , partioning and replication): Need to take care of data consistency.
Distributed Caching ( to reduce db reads)
Geo-distribution ( keep the data close to user)
Microservice Architecture: breaking down your system into smaller, independently deployable services that communicate via APIs. 
By adopting a microservices architecture, you can achieve greater flexibility and scalability, as each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. 
Data compression

In AWS: LoadBalancer(ALB) for ur Ec2 instances and ASG.

Microservices
## Sharding :  Splits a database into smaller, more manageable pieces. Eg: Shard by location, shrad by first letter of name.
Selecting the right shard key is crucial. Some shards can become hotspots. Most of the query to a single shrad.
If data is in different shrads, it may result in cross-shard query which result in increased latency. Query patterns need to decide the shrad key.
Reshrading or redistribuing data is difficult.
## Event sourcing
Circuit Breaker
Reverse proxy
Backpressure
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Object Pool

Time-series databases

Why is it hard to horizontally scale(shrading) SQL databases? 
Due to relationships between data and ACID properties for transactions.
**Atomicity**: Each transaction is all or nothing. If one part of transaction fails, then whole transaction fails. 
In a distributed system it is difficult to coordinate the transactions across multiple nodes and to rollback transactions in case of partial failures. 
It needs two phase commit. 
**Consistency**: Transactions change the system from one valid state to another and all constaints are valid. Need distributed locks and consensus algorithm.
**Isolation**: Concurrent transactions occur as if they are happening sequentially.
**Durability**: Data once committed is saved for ever.
Introduce network latency as shrads can be in different servers.
Joins across multiple shards, Transactions across multiple shards, Maintaining constraints like foreign key, unique key are difficult in a distributed system.

Consistency in ACID and consistency in CAP refers to different consistency. 

Atomic Consistency(in CAP theorem) ensures that all processing units(nodes or threads) see the same updates in the same order as if they were made by a single processing unit. 
It guarantees that updates made by one processing unit are immediately visible to all other processing units. 

Tradeoff : Consistency vs Performance/Availability. 

To mitigate issues with shrading: Application level Sharding, Consistent Hashing, Database Middleware, Denormalization, Polygot Persistence, Geo-Partitioning

Before taking on a project as big as sharding, it’s often best to first ensure you have a sound foundation upon which you plan to extend the architecture.

Chat Service
      * Receive messages from client
                  * Client starts the communication
                  * Protocol : HTTP
                  * keep-alive header allows a client to maintain a persistent connection with the chat service. It also reduces the number of TCP handshakes. 
                  * We can use websocket also
      * Store the message
      * Send message to receiver
                  * This is a server initiated communication.
                  * Options are polling, long polling, and WebSocket
                  * Polling : Not good for less chatty clients
                  * WebSocket is the most common solution for sending asynchronous updates from server to client. 
                  * Client iniatites. It is bidirectional.

Since websocket are persistent connection, connection management is critical.
The WebSocket connection is kept alive for as long as needed (in theory, it can last forever), allowing the server and the client to send data at will, with minimal overhead. To scale we need horizontal scaling of servers. 

Websockets are stateful and HTTP is stateless. A client normally does not switch to another chat server as long as the server is still available.We need a Service Discovery service for the client to discover which chat server it should connect to.  The primary role of service discovery is to recommend the best chat server for a client based on the criteria like geographical location, server capacity, etc. Apache Zookeeper is a popular open-source solution for service discovery. It registers all the available chat servers and picks the best chat server for a client based on predefined criteria.


Push Notification: When when tha app is not running, client should be notified of new message. 

Message Flow

1. User A sends a chat message to Chat server 1.

2. Chat server 1 obtains a message ID from the ID generator.

3. Chat server 1 sends the message to the message sync queue.

4. The message is stored in a key-value store.

5.a. If User B is online, the message is forwarded to Chat server 2 where User B is connected.

5.b. If User B is offline, a push notification is sent from push notification (PN) servers.

6. Chat server 2 forwards the message to User B. There is a persistent WebSocket connection between User B and Chat server 2.

For Online/Offline status: Use a pub/sub mechanism.
Using a heart beat mechanism to update online/offline status of a user.  Status is stored in presence server.
As soon as status is changed, presense server publish the change. The user's friend is subscribed to this change. There will be a channel for each user -friend pair. Status change is published to all friend's channel.


Scalability:
No of concurrent connection a server can handle.
1 M concurrent user 
each connection 10K memory
10 GB memory in total - Can fit in one server

1 MB - 1000 KB
1 GB - 1000 MB
1 GB - 10 ^ 6 KB

Database Selection:
for chat data - 60 billion messages per day
Most recent chat + random access of data for search
** Key Value ** database
Facebook use HBase ( Key-Value)
Discord use Cassandra(Key-Value)

Message Table(1:1 chat)
message_id
message_from
message_to
content
created_at

Group Message Table(group chat)
channel_id # partionId
message_id
user_id

Technologies:
Front End : Native mobile app specific to each platform
To store data locally in mobile - SQLite. Relational database in your phone.

Websocket:
WebSocket connection is initiated by the client. It is bi-directional and persistent. It starts its life as a HTTP connection and could be “upgraded” via some well-defined handshake to a WebSocket connection. Through this persistent connection, a server could send updates to a client. WebSocket connections generally work even if a firewall is in place. This is because they use port 80 or 443 which are also used by HTTP/HTTPS connections.     

Client --- HTTP Handshake --- Server --- Sends Ack

## Generating a unique Id
GUID: nearly guaranteed to be unique. 128 bits long. 32 hex digit.  
eg: 30dd879c-ee2f-11db-8314-0800200c9a66 (8–4–4–4–12)
But problem with GUIDs are that there can be collisions howsoever minuscule that probability is.
Other problems: They are longer( we may need shorter guids. Longer keys cannot be indexed). They are not sortable. 
The SQL auto increment sequence id - Results in single point of failure. We cannot scale it. If we use two servers, then it will not become sortable.

How others are solving this problem? - https://aaronice.gitbook.io/system-design/architecture-toolbox/id-generator?source=post_page-----d6a440cc8e5--------------------------------#single-machine

Flickr Ticket Service(https://code.flickr.net/2010/02/08/ticket-servers-distributed-unique-primary-keys-on-the-cheap/)
* Generate unique sortable keys at scale.
* Flickr use a single database to generate uniqueId. SELECT * from Tickets64 returns a single row with latest Id. To compensate single point of failure, two servers are used one for generating odd ids and another for even ids. It generate unique ids but they are not sortable.
Twitter Snowflake(https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2010/announcing-snowflake) 
* Final ID = Timestamp + ServerID + Counter

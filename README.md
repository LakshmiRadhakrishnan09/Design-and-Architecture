Client: \
Backend: In AWS EC2 instance. 3 AWS regions. Within each region, 3 AZ. Videos in S3. \
CDN: Netflix's custom global CDN is called OpenConnect. OpenConnect stores videos in different edge locations around the world.

### Sharding

Sharding is the method of distributing a single dataset across multiple machines. It is a form of Horizontal Scaling. \
Advantage: Increase scaling capability. Increased read/write throughput. \
Disadvantage: It increases system complexity as we need to distribute data based on shard and properly route requests.

Types:\
Ranged Sharding: Allocates a range for a field on a shard. Need a lookup table. \
Hashed Sharding: Apply hashing alogorithm on a field. No need for lookup table. Rehasing results in an outage \
Entity based Sharding: Keep related data together. \
GeoSharding: Shared key based on geography and shards themselves are geo-located.

## Load Balancing

Ensure Availability: Direct traffic to only healthy servers. \
Ensure Scalability: Can add more resources at backend. \

### Algorithm Techniques
<ul>
  <li>RoundRobin</li>
  <li>Weighted RoundRobin</li>
  <li>Least Connection</li>
  <li>Resourse Based</li>
  <li>Source IP Hash</li>
</ul>

### Use case discussions
1. In a shopping cart application, how added items can be stored?
   * Locally in browser. If you are using a load balancer, all request from client should be sent to same backend server during the duration of session. 
   * How to store session in browser?
2.
